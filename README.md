Currently, companies have no way to track the complete history of salary packages and benefits of potential employees they are considering for a role. This can lead to companies offering packages that are either too low or too high, which can be detrimental to both the company and the employee.

This project will solve this problem by creating a central employee job history repository. This repository will use blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent record of all employee job history data. This will allow companies to easily track the complete history of salary packages and benefits for potential employees. This will help companies to offer more competitive packages and attract the best talent.
